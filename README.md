## About Me

Hello! I'm interested in the intersection of theoretical physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. My current projects on github include

- code for exploring an integral-equation approach to cosmological perturbations
- code to determine the density profile for neutrinos around dark-matter halos
- contributions to figuring out how to implement the integral-equation approach for non-cold relics in CLASS
